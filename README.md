# Titanic-with-K-Nearest-Neighbors-Classifier

In this repository we will apply k Nearest Neighbors classification algorithm to Titanic data set.

It aims to give you an accessible introduction on how to use kNN machine learning technique for your projects and data sets.

We will start from loading data, next is preprocessing data, then exploratory data analysis and then making classification by using kNN algorithm.

Lastly, to evaluate our model,s performance we calculated accuracy, recall, precision scores, confusion matrix, and ROC curve.
